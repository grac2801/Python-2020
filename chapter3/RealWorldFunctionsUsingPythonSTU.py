    In a particular jurisdiction, taxi fares consist of a base fare of $4.00, 
    plus $0.25 for every 140 meters traveled. Write a function that takes 
    the distance traveled (in meters) as its only parameter and returns
    the total fare as its only result, but converts the meters to miles
    within the function, [1 km --> 0.621371 miles] and displays both the 
    amount of kilometers and its conversion to the user, plus the total 
    amount due. (American travelers like to see this conversion in European 
    or Latin American countries)
    
    Format the output so that it includes a dollar sign, and
    
    The result should always display two decimal places.
    
    Add the correct docString to this function

    In many jurisdictions a small deposit is added to drink containers to
     encourage people to recycle them. In one particular jurisdiction, 
     drink containers holding one liter or less have a $0.10 deposit, 
     and drink containers holding more than one liter have a $0.25 deposit.
     
     Write a program that reads:
    1. The number of containers of each size from the user ( 1L or less and over 1 L)
    
    2. Your program should continue by computing and displaying the refund 
       that will be received for returning each of those containers volumes. 
       ( Less than 1 liter, and 1 liter and above)
    
    3. Format the output so that it includes a dollar sign, and
    
    4. The result should always display two decimal places.

    Write a program which provides an online retailer shipping fees at these
    rates:
    a) The first item is $11.00
    b) Any subsequent items  will be $3.00 each
    c) Any 'expedited' items will cost $15.00
    Develop a program which will ask the user how many items are being shipped,
    and how many are expedited items. (only 2 questions should be asked)
    d) The program should provide a subtotal at this point.
    e) The program should add a tax of 8.00% 
    f) Finally, it should also provide a total amount, and thank the user 
    for using its services.
    
    Format the output so that it includes a dollar sign, and
    The result should always display two decimal places.
